**Logistic Regression**

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that accomplishes binary classification task by predicting 
the probablity of an outcome, event or observation. The model delivers a binary outcome limited to two possible outcomes: 
yes/no, true/false, or 0/1.

Logical regression analyzes the relationship between one or more independent variables and classifies data into discrete 
classes.It is extensively used in predictive modeling, where the model estimates the mathematical probability of whether an instance belongs to a specific category or not.

For example, 0 – represents a negative class; 1 – represents a positive class. Logistic regression is commonly used in binary classification problems where the outcome variable reveals either of the two categories (0 and 1).

Mathematically, the logistic regression model is defined as:

**f(x) = 1 / 1 + e^-x**

**Application of Logistic Regression**

1. **Determine the probability of heart attacks:** With the help of a logistic model, medical practitioners can determine the relationship between variables such as the weight, exercise, etc., of an individual and use it to predict whether the person will suffer from a heart attack or any other medical complication.

2. **Possibility of enrolling into a university:** Application aggregators can determine the probability of a student getting accepted to a particular university or a degree course in a college by studying the relationship between the estimator variables, such as GRE, GMAT, or TOEFL scores.

3. **Identifying spam emails:** Email inboxes are filtered to determine if the email communication is promotional/spam by understanding the predictor variables and applying a logistic regression algorithm to check its authenticity.
